# Production Ready

This skill exists to solve one specific failure mode. AI-generated dashboards that *look* finished but are hollow. Buttons that don't save. Filters that don't filter. Charts hardcoded to fake JSON. Sidebars where half the links 404. Login screens that accept anything. The user runs it, and within ten seconds discovers it's a museum, not a tool.

The job here is the opposite. Ship a dashboard where every visible element is connected to something real. If a button is on the screen, clicking it does the thing. If a chart is on the screen, it reflects actual data. If there's a "users" page, you can actually create, edit, delete, and assign roles, and those changes persist across reloads.

This is harder than it sounds because dashboards are *systems*, not screens. A dashboard touches the data model, the API, auth, RBAC, navigation, state, caching, forms, charts, empty states, error states, audit, and exports. If any one layer is faked, the whole thing collapses into a demo.

## Core principle: vertical slices, not horizontal layers

Do not build the dashboard layer-by-layer (database, then API, then auth, then routes, then UI, then charts). That path produces 80% completion on every layer and 0% completion on any actual feature. Instead, build **vertical slices**:

> One feature at a time, end-to-end, working, before moving on.

A vertical slice for "user management" means: schema migration, API endpoints, permission checks, service layer, query hooks, list page, detail page, create/edit form, delete confirmation, empty and error and loading states, audit log entry, tested with seeded users, *all done* before touching the next feature. When the slice is complete, an actual person can do an actual job with it.

This principle is non-negotiable. It is the single biggest determinant of whether the output is a working dashboard or a scaffold.

## When this skill does NOT apply

Route elsewhere if the request is:
- **Single-component or single-page** ("add one chart," "build a landing page"). This skill is for multi-page systems.
- **Repo hygiene** (README, LICENSE, CI, CONTRIBUTING, issue templates, release automation). Delegate to the `repo-ready` skill.
- **Marketing site, blog, or docs site.** Frontend-only content sites do not have the auth, data, RBAC, and audit surface this skill enforces.
- **Greenfield repo scaffolding only.** If the user wants "set up my repo," that's `repo-ready`. This skill takes over once app features are being built.

## Workflow

Follow this sequence. Skipping steps is how dashboards end up hollow.

### Step 0. Detect project state and research

Read `references/codebase-research.md` and run the mode detection protocol.

- **Empty or boilerplate** routes to Mode A (Greenfield). Quick external-constraints scan, then proceed.
- **Existing source code** routes to Mode B (Assessment). Run the full scan before step 1. Its output replaces guesswork and constrains the architecture step.
- **User asked to audit/verify/harden** routes to Mode C (Audit). Verification-focused scan, produce a fix-it list, skip steps 1 through 6, go directly to fixing what's broken.
- **Inheriting a half-built project or an off-the-shelf template** (Retool export, Appsmith, shadcn admin kit, another agent's unfinished work, a Vue-to-React migration, a WordPress-to-Rails port) routes to Mode D (Migration). Treat the existing code as scaffolding measured against the tier requirements, not as ground truth. Inventory three buckets: what to keep (meets the tier bar), what to rewrite (hollow or mis-patterned), what to discard (dead paths). Preserve only what earns its place.

**Passes when:** a mode is declared, and the corresponding research output is produced (the block specified in `codebase-research.md` for that mode).

### Step 1. Pre-flight

Read `references/preflight-and-verification.md`. Answer the 12 questions in writing. In Mode B, pre-fill answers from the assessment output and focus on the gaps.

Once the domain is identified, read the matching section of `references/domain-considerations.md`. It carries domain-specific data-model traps, compliance requirements, and UX patterns that generic CRUD misses. Skipping this is how dashboards end up with float-based currency, single-entry accounting, or missing HIPAA audit logs.

If the request is vague ("build me a dashboard"), do not interrogate the user. Pick the most plausible interpretation, state assumptions in one short paragraph, and proceed. See the "vague request interpretation" table in `references/domain-considerations.md`.

**Passes when:** all 12 pre-flight questions are answered in writing, the domain is named, and any Tier 1 remaps from `domain-considerations.md` are stated explicitly in the answer to question 1.

### Step 2. Architecture note

Produce a short note (5 to 15 lines) covering:

- **Stack.** Framework, language, ORM/DB, auth provider, styling, state library, chart library.
- **Data source.** Real DB, existing API, or local persistence that behaves like real (SQLite plus Prisma, Convex, Supabase, Postgres in Docker). Never in-memory state or hardcoded JSON.
- **Auth model.** Sessions vs. JWT, where the user record lives, how roles attach.
- **Permission model.** RBAC role list and the resource by action matrix.
- **Route map.** Every page, parent to child nesting.
- **Threat model.** Three answers, one line each: (1) what does an attacker gain from this system (data, money, identity, control); (2) what is the highest-blast-radius mutation (who can `DELETE`, who can alter billing, who can impersonate); (3) where is each trust boundary (network edge, session, role, tenant). For regulated domains (healthcare, finance, legal, HR, government), add the compliance blast radius: what kind of incident would trigger a disclosure obligation. This is not a deep threat model; it is the minimum signal needed so the server-side checks in Step 4 aren't guesswork.
- **Visual identity.** Archetype, palette, typography, radius, density, signature detail (see step 3).

**In Mode B or D:** don't decide, document. Architecture note adopts what exists and adds only what's missing.

**Passes when:** the architecture note exists with every required bullet filled (stack, data source, auth model, permission model, route map, threat model, visual identity). Any missing bullet means the note is not done.

### Step 3. Derive the visual identity

Before any component code, commit to a visual personality derived from the domain, not from component-library defaults. Read `references/ui-design-patterns.md` and work through its "Visual identity" decision framework:

1. Pick an aesthetic archetype from the 10 in that file.
2. Make 5 decisions: color palette, typography pairing, border radius, density, signature detail.
3. Output the CSS design-token block and apply it globally.

Two users asking for "a SaaS dashboard" must get two dashboards that look different. Shipping with unmodified shadcn/Radix/MUI defaults is the visual equivalent of `// TODO`.

**Passes when:** the archetype is chosen, the 5 decisions are recorded in the architecture note, the CSS token block is applied globally, and at least one rendered component visibly inherits from `--color-primary` rather than a library default.

### Step 4. Build the foundation slice

Always the same, always first:

1. Project bootstrapped, runs locally.
2. **Verify every dependency exists before installing.** AI suggestions produce ghost packages roughly 20% of the time (Socket, 2025). Before running `npm install`, `pip install`, `bundle add`, `composer require`, or equivalent, confirm for each unfamiliar package: (a) it actually exists on the registry; (b) the publisher name matches what you expect (`@tanstack/react-query` is real, `@tansatck/react-query` is a squat); (c) weekly download count is non-trivial (1k plus is a sane floor for serious deps). A quick check: `npm view <pkg> name maintainers` or the registry's web page. Reject ghost packages. Never install a registry name an LLM produced without this check. See `references/performance-and-security.md` for the supply-chain deep dive.
3. Design tokens applied globally. Fonts loaded. Every component inherits from tokens.
4. Database or persistence up, migrations applied, seed script with at least one admin and 5 to 20 realistic rows per main entity.
5. Auth working: login, logout, session persistence, password hashing (argon2 or bcrypt, never plain, never sha256), middleware that gates protected routes server-side.
6. RBAC working: at least two roles, server-side permission checks, a way to verify what a non-admin sees. Every check maps back to a trust boundary from the Step 2 threat model.
7. Shell layout: header (logo top-left, user menu top-right), sidebar nav, content area, breadcrumbs, responsive collapse. Tokens applied, not default theme.
8. One real protected page reachable end-to-end.

**Proof test before declaring Tier 1:** run the app, sign in as admin, see the landing page with real data, visit a CRUD page, create, edit, delete, sign out, sign in as non-admin, confirm different UI and 403 on forbidden mutations, reload, confirm data persists. Inspect one button and verify its color traces to `--color-primary`, not a library default. Confirm every dependency in `package.json` (or equivalent) is a real, published package with a known publisher. **Click every primary and secondary CTA on every page the slice touches, including drawer triggers, menu items, and form submits. Each must complete its chain to a real user-visible outcome. A 404 on navigation, an empty modal or drawer, a silent mutation with no cache invalidation or toast, or a form that submits into the void is a Tier 1 failure.** If this loop works, Tier 1 is complete. Run the hollow check.

### Step 5. Build feature slices

For each feature, follow this recipe:

1. Schema or migration if new entities.
2. Seed data.
3. Server: list (paginate, filter, sort), detail, create, update, delete, all with permission checks that map to the threat model's trust boundaries.
4. Client: query hooks for read, mutation hooks for write, cache invalidation.
5. Pages: list (empty, loading, error states), detail, create/edit form (client and server validation, submission states, success and error feedback), delete confirmation.
6. Audit: every mutation writes an audit log entry.
7. Smoke test: walk create, edit, delete manually before declaring the slice done.
8. **Decision record (ADR) if the slice made a non-obvious choice.** Three lines in `.production-ready/adr/NNN-slug.md`: what was decided, why, what was rejected and why. Skip for obvious decisions ("used the already-chosen ORM"). Write for decisions a future maintainer would have to reverse-engineer from code: "chose event sourcing over CRUD for this entity," "split `orders` and `order_items` as separate aggregates," "bypass the query layer for this report because it aggregates across tenants." The ADR is the only way the next human or agent inherits your reasoning rather than rediscovering it. Three lines. If you need more, you are over-documenting.
9. **CTA flow completeness audit.** For every interactive element the slice added (button, link, form submit, menu item, drawer trigger, toolbar action), walk the full chain it initiates, not just the leaf handler. Every chain must end at a real user-visible outcome: a page that renders, a record that persists, a toast that confirms, a list that refreshes, a drawer that shows real content. The leaf `onClick` being non-empty is *not* the gate. The chain completing is the gate. The five half-wired shapes to catch: (a) navigation to a route the app does not register; (b) a dialog, drawer, or sheet whose body is an empty shell; (c) a mutation that fires but never invalidates the cache, toasts, or redirects, leaving the user uncertain it worked; (d) a dispatched action with no matching handler or reducer; (e) a form whose `onSubmit` is wired but whose handler ignores the response or leaves the form in a success-indistinguishable-from-failure state. If a CTA depends on something not yet built, build it in this slice, because the slice is defined by the feature, not by the happy-path component. If that is genuinely impossible (the flow is blocked on a third-party integration the user has not provisioned, for example), pick exactly one of these three before shipping, never a fourth: **(i) remove the CTA** from the UI, **(ii) disable the CTA** with a visible reason the user can read at a glance (tooltip-only reasons do not count), or **(iii) log the CTA as deferred** in `.production-ready/deferred-cta.md` using the entry schema and lifecycle rules specified in the "Deferred CTA lifecycle" section below. An entry that skips any required field (or names a vague blocker like "later") fails the slice's Passes-when gate. Half-wired CTAs in the UI are a slice failure.

Order of slices: most-used first, riskiest second, nice-to-haves last. If the user runs out of patience halfway through, the most important feature is still complete.

**Passes when:** every recipe item is complete for the slice, the smoke test (create, edit, delete against the real data source) passes, the CTA flow completeness audit returns zero half-wired CTAs (or every exception is logged in `.production-ready/deferred-cta.md`), and an ADR exists in `.production-ready/adr/` for any non-obvious choice the slice made.

### Step 5.1. Hollow-check protocol (after every slice)

Runs in 30 seconds, catches hollows while they're cheap to fix. Adapt the patterns to your stack.

```
# TypeScript / JavaScript
grep -rnE "// (TODO|FIXME|HACK|TEMP)" src/
grep -rnE "(\(\)\s*=>\s*\{\s*\}|onClick=\{\(\)\s*=>\s*\{\s*\}\})" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
grep -rn "console\.log" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
grep -rnE "(mock|fake|dummy)Data\b|Lorem|lorem ipsum" src/
grep -rn "Math\.random()" src/

# Python (Django, FastAPI, Flask)
grep -rnE "# (TODO|FIXME|XXX)" . --include="*.py"
grep -rn "raise NotImplementedError" . --include="*.py"
grep -rn "^\s*pass\s*#" . --include="*.py"

# Ruby (Rails)
grep -rnE "# (TODO|FIXME)" app/ lib/
grep -rn "raise ['\"]TODO" app/ lib/
grep -rn "binding\.pry\|byebug\|debugger" app/ lib/

# PHP (Laravel)
grep -rnE "// (TODO|FIXME)" app/ resources/
grep -rn "dd(\|dump(\|var_dump(" app/ resources/

# Universal
grep -rnE "Coming soon|Not implemented|Placeholder|TBD|WIP" .

# Ghost dependency check (run after any package add)
# npm / pnpm / yarn
jq -r '.dependencies, .devDependencies | keys[]?' package.json 2>/dev/null | while read -r pkg; do
  npm view "$pkg" name > /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "GHOST: $pkg not published on npm"
done
# Python
pip install --dry-run -r requirements.txt 2>&1 | grep -i "could not find"
# Ruby
bundle check 2>&1 | grep -i "could not find"

# CTA flow completeness (catches half-wired buttons / dead chains)
# Navigation destinations: flag router.push / navigate to routes the app may not register.
# These are candidates for cross-checking against the route map, not automatic failures.
grep -rnE "(router\.(push|navigate|replace)|useNavigate\(\)|navigate)\((\`|['\"])/" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
# Empty dialog / drawer / sheet shells: common in shadcn/Radix/MUI stubs.
grep -rnE "<(Dialog|Drawer|Sheet|Modal|Popover)(Content)?[^>]*>\s*</(Dialog|Drawer|Sheet|Modal|Popover)(Content)?>" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx"
# Mutations without onSuccess / invalidation: likely silent-fire.
grep -rnE "useMutation\(\{[^}]*mutationFn" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" -A 10 | grep -B 1 -E "^\s*\}\)" | grep -v "onSuccess\|invalidate"
# Forms without onSubmit:
grep -rnE "<form(\s[^>]*)?>" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" | grep -v "onSubmit\|action=" || true
```

**Rule:** zero hits before the next slice. No severity ladder, no batching "for cleanup later." If the scan finds a TODO you wrote ten minutes ago, fix it now. There is one narrow exclusion: legitimate `console.error` or structured logger calls in catch blocks are not hits and do not need to be cleaned up. Raw `console.log`, `dd()`, `binding.pry`, `dump()`, and `var_dump()` in production paths always are, and always block. Any `GHOST:` hit is always a failure: stop, remove the package, re-verify the real name, re-install. **CTA flow hits are heuristic, not automatic failures.** Navigation destinations need to be cross-checked against the route map; empty dialog/drawer shells are sometimes intentional placeholders for late-binding children, and some mutations invalidate caches elsewhere. Treat CTA hits as a manual-audit list: for each, confirm the chain completes. Any chain that does not complete is a half-wired CTA and blocks the slice.

**When to run:** after each slice (scan touched files only), and at each tier boundary (scan everything).

**Passes when:** the scan returns zero hits for the scope of the run, with the single exclusion above (logger calls in catch blocks).

### Step 6. Cross-cutting concerns

After two or three slices, layer in: global search, notifications, preferences, theme toggle, exports, audit log viewer, profile page. Easier once real data flows.

**Passes when:** at least one cross-cutting feature is live, wired to real data, and reachable from the shell. Two or three is better, but one is the minimum to declare Step 6 done for a given tier cycle.

### Step 7. Tests alongside each slice

A slice isn't done until it has tests. Read `references/testing-and-quality.md`. Minimum per slice:

- Integration test walking the CRUD flow end-to-end.
- Permission test confirming non-admin users are blocked.
- Accessibility test (axe) on every new page.
- **Contract test for cross-slice public signatures (graduated).** If the slice adds or changes a public API endpoint, server action, event payload, or exported type that another slice imports or calls, pin it with a schema-level contract test. Choose the style that fits the stack: OpenAPI snapshot for REST, zod/valibot `.parse()` round-trip for Node, TypeScript type-level test (`expectTypeOf`), or a recorded consumer contract (Pact). The test fails when the shape changes. If an intentional breaking change is needed, update the contract test *and* write an ADR explaining the alternatives rejected. Slices with no downstream consumer (a leaf feature no other slice imports) can skip this; the test becomes mandatory the moment a second slice depends on the signature. This is the only reliable guard against the silent-refactor failure mode where a rename or a `Promise`-wrap breaks a consumer three days later.

**Passes when:** each slice has integration, permission, and axe tests; every cross-slice public signature has a contract test; and the full test suite is green.

### Step 8. Harden performance and security

Before verification, read `references/performance-and-security.md` and apply:

- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy).
- Bundle budget (code-split, lazy-load heavy libs).
- Rate limiting on login, mutations, uploads, exports.
- `npm audit` (or equivalent); fix critical and high.
- No secrets in git; no server secrets leaking to the client bundle.

**Passes when:** security headers return via curl or the browser inspector, the bundle is under the declared budget, rate limits reject the known abuse cases, `npm audit` (or equivalent) reports zero critical/high issues, and a search for common secret patterns in the client bundle comes up empty.

### Step 9. Verification

Walk the verification checklist in `references/preflight-and-verification.md` and the security checklist in `references/performance-and-security.md`. If the repo also lacks CI, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, or release automation, invoke the `repo-ready` skill. Do not duplicate that work here.

**Passes when:** every box on the pre-flight verification checklist and the security checklist is green, the `repo-ready` handoff has been made or declined with reason, and the final Tier boundary has been declared explicitly ("Tier N complete").

## Completion tiers

24 requirements across 4 tiers. The agent aims for the highest tier the session allows. Declare each tier explicitly at its boundary. Never leave a tier half-done. Finish the current slice and declare the last complete tier.

In Mode B, the research output's gap analysis maps directly to unfulfilled tier requirements. Determine the current tier, then work toward the next.

### Tier 1: Foundation (8)

The dashboard runs, authenticates, and shows real data. One person can do one real job with it.

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Real auth.** Login rejects bad credentials, stores a session, gates every protected route server-side. |
| 2 | **Real data.** Seeded into a real persistence layer. Reloads persist. Two browsers see consistent state. |
| 3 | **A shell.** Header (logo top-left, user menu top-right), persistent sidebar, content area. |
| 4 | **Working navigation.** Every sidebar link routes somewhere real. Active state highlights current page. |
| 5 | **A landing page.** Route after login shows something useful: KPI cards, a chart, or an activity feed. Not lorem ipsum. |
| 6 | **At least one full CRUD entity.** List, detail, create, edit, delete, wired and persisted. |
| 7 | **A logout button** that actually invalidates the session. |
| 8 | **A visual identity.** Design tokens applied: palette, typography, radius, density. Not default component-library styling. |

### Tier 2: Functional (7)

Multiple features, roles, edge cases. A team can use it daily.

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 9 | **Real RBAC.** At least two roles. Server-side permission checks on every mutation. UI hides unauthorized actions as courtesy, never as security. |
| 10 | **Loading, empty, and error states** for every async surface. Specific, not generic spinners. |
| 11 | **Form validation.** Client for instant feedback, server for truth. Inline field-level errors. |
| 12 | **Success and error feedback.** Toasts or banners after every mutation. Never silent. |
| 13 | **Pagination, sorting, filtering** on any table that could exceed 25 rows. State preserved in URL. |
| 14 | **A settings page** that actually saves. |
| 15 | **A user profile or account page** the logged-in user can edit. |

### Tier 3: Polished (5)

Cross-cutting concerns and accessibility. Ready for internal use or beta.

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 16 | **An audit log** of who did what, when. |
| 17 | **Keyboard accessibility.** Every interactive element Tab-reachable. Focus styles visible. No keyboard traps. |
| 18 | **Responsive layout.** Works at 1440, 1024, 768, 375. Sidebar collapses to drawer on mobile. |
| 19 | **Breadcrumbs** on nested pages. Sub-menus expand and collapse, and remember state. |
| 20 | **Cross-cutting concerns wired:** search, exports, notifications, or theme toggle, whichever the domain needs. |

### Tier 4: Hardened (4)

Ship-ready. Tested, secure, verified.

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 21 | **Tests.** Auth flow, one CRUD flow, one permission denial, axe on every page, and a contract test for every public API signature, server action, or exported type that crosses slice boundaries. |
| 22 | **Security headers.** CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy. No secrets in git. Rate limits on login and mutations. |
| 23 | **Verification checklist passed.** Full checklist from `references/preflight-and-verification.md` walked and green. |
| 24 | **No hollow indicators and no open work.** Zero TODOs, zero raw `console.log`, `dd()`, or `binding.pry` in production paths, zero hardcoded data, zero empty handlers, zero live entries in `.production-ready/deferred-cta.md` (every entry `resolved` or `dropped`), zero `open` questions in STATE.md, and for Mode D projects, zero unshipped `rewrite` items in the migration disposition inventory (every item `shipped` or explicitly `reclassified-as-dropped` with an ADR). |

**Proof test:** build succeeds clean, tests pass, lint passes, DevTools shows zero red errors and zero failed requests. If the repo lacks CI, LICENSE, or release automation, hand off to `repo-ready`.

## The "have-nots": things that disqualify the dashboard at any tier

If any of these appear, the dashboard fails the no-scaffold rule and must be fixed:

- `// TODO`, `# TODO`, `// FIXME`, `# implement later`, `// hook up to API` in any file
- Raw `console.log`, `dd()`, `binding.pry`, `var_dump()`, or debug `print()` left in production paths
- Hardcoded arrays of fake data inside components (data must come from the data layer)
- `Math.random()` driving any chart or KPI
- `alert()` or `prompt()` for user interaction
- "Coming soon" pages or disabled nav items
- Permission checks that exist *only* on the client (server must enforce)
- Forms that POST and ignore the response
- Buttons whose `onClick` is `() => {}`, `undefined`, or `console.log("clicked")`
- Routes in the sidebar that 404
- Charts that re-randomize on every render
- Login pages that accept any credentials
- Any "demo mode" or "placeholder" copy visible to the user
- Components named `ExampleX`, `DemoY`, `TestZ` shipped to the user
- Unmodified shadcn/Radix/MUI default theme visible to the user
- Installing a package without confirming it exists on the registry with a real publisher (slopsquatting protection)
- A non-obvious architectural decision made with no corresponding ADR in `.production-ready/adr/`
- Running a destructive command (`rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, `git push --force`, `prisma migrate reset`) without an explicit confirmation step and a known backup
- A **half-wired CTA**: a button, link, form submit, menu item, or drawer trigger whose *chain* does not complete to a real user-visible outcome. The leaf handler being non-empty is not enough. Shapes that disqualify: navigation to a route the app does not register; a dialog, drawer, or sheet that renders empty; a mutation that fires but never invalidates cache, toasts, or redirects; a dispatched action with no handler or reducer; a form whose submit handler ignores the response. If the chain cannot ship in the current slice, remove the CTA, disable it with a visible reason, or log it in `.production-ready/deferred-cta.md`. Never ship it half-wired.

When you catch yourself about to write any of these, do the real version instead. The real version is almost always 10 to 30 more lines, not 10x more.

## Deferred CTA lifecycle

The deferred-CTA escape hatch from Step 5 item 9 exists so slices can ship when a chain is legitimately blocked on external work. Without a closure discipline, the deferred list becomes a junk drawer of forgotten buttons. These rules give it a forcing function.

**Entry schema.** Every row in `.production-ready/deferred-cta.md` must have all of the following. Entries missing any field fail the slice's Passes-when gate.

| Field | Required content |
|---|---|
| **Location** | File path, component name, and the role the CTA plays in the UI (for example `src/features/billing/PlanCard.tsx: "Change Plan" primary button`). |
| **Intended chain** | What the chain is supposed to do, end-to-end, in one sentence. "Opens a plan-picker drawer, calls `POST /api/billing/change-plan`, shows a proration summary, redirects to the settings page with a success toast." |
| **Blocker** | The specific reason it cannot ship in the current slice. "Stripe is not yet provisioned in this environment" is specific. "Later" or "needs more work" is not. Vague blockers fail the schema. |
| **Target slice or milestone** | The named slice or Tier boundary where this is expected to ship. "Billing slice, Tier 2" or "After Stripe provisioning, before Tier 3 boundary." |
| **Status** | One of `deferred` (not started), `in-progress` (active work in the current slice), `resolved` (the chain shipped, close the entry), `dropped` (decided not to build, with a one-line reason). |

**Tier-boundary review.** At every tier boundary (Tier 1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 4), walk `deferred-cta.md` entry by entry before declaring the new tier complete:
- If the blocker is resolved, ship the CTA *in the current tier cycle*. It rides into whatever slice its chain belongs to, not as a separate slice.
- If the blocker is still real, leave the entry in place and append a check date. An entry that has sat `deferred` across two tier boundaries with no progress is a scope signal: either the feature is real and deserves a slice, or it was never needed and should be `dropped`.
- If the CTA was a mistake (scope creep that never deserved a button), mark it `dropped` with a one-line reason. Dropped entries stay in the file for audit history.

**Tier 4 closure gate.** Tier 4 (Hardened) cannot be declared complete while any entry in `deferred-cta.md` is `deferred` or `in-progress`. Every entry must be `resolved` or `dropped`. This is the same discipline as "zero TODOs at Tier 4": deferred CTAs are TODOs the user can see, and shipping them live is the failure mode the skill exists to prevent.

**Disabled-with-reason CTAs parallel the deferred list.** If a CTA is disabled pending future work (the user sees the button but cannot click it), it must also appear in `deferred-cta.md` with the same schema. A permanently disabled CTA that is gated by plan tier, feature flag, or subscription is *not* a deferred CTA. That is a feature-gate, which is a legitimate pattern. The difference: a feature-gate is the final state; a deferred-disabled is a temporary state with a target slice to ship.

**Removal is clean and silent.** A removed CTA does not need tracking. Git history holds it if anyone wants to restore. One exception: if the CTA was visible in a *prior released* version, prefer disable-plus-track over silent removal. Silent removal of a button users have seen is a UX regression; disabling it with a visible reason ("Temporarily unavailable while we rebuild this flow") plus a deferred entry is the honest path.

**Audit cadence for the file itself.** `deferred-cta.md` is append-and-update, not edit-and-forget. Every entry accumulates check dates at each tier boundary, producing an honest history. If the file grows beyond 10 live `deferred` entries, that is a signal the slice scope is drifting: the slice should probably be broken up or features cut.

## Reference files: load on demand

The body above is enough to start. Load each reference *before* implementing that layer, not after.

| Reference file | When to load |
|---|---|

Skill version and change history live in `CHANGELOG.md`. When resuming a project, confirm the skill version your session loaded matches the version recorded in `.production-ready/STATE.md`. A skill update between sessions may change hollow-check patterns, add tier requirements, or shift items between tiers (especially for regulated domains). If the versions differ, re-run the hollow check and re-read the changed sections before continuing.

## Session state and handoff

Long builds span sessions. Without a state file, every resume rediscovers context from the code and drops the decisions made in earlier sessions. The second diagnosis of context-entropy failures (Pragmatic Engineer, r/ExperiencedDevs) is always the same: "the AI's context window can only see fragments, and developers have no map to find a stable version."

Maintain `.production-ready/STATE.md` as the map. Update it at every tier boundary, every session end, and whenever the harness compacts context. Read it first on resume. If it conflicts with the code, trust the code and update the file.

**Template:**

```markdown
# Production-Ready State

## Skill version
Built under production-ready 2.5.2. If the agent loads a newer version on resume, re-run the hollow check and re-read the changed sections before continuing.

## Current tier
Working toward Tier [N]. Last completed tier: [N-1]. Declared at [ISO date].

## Slices completed
- [x] users (Tier 1, completed 2026-04-18)
- [x] orders (Tier 2, completed 2026-04-20)
- [ ] billing (in progress, started 2026-04-22)

## Active architectural decisions
- Stack: Next.js 15 + Prisma + SQLite (dev) / Postgres (prod) + Better Auth + shadcn/ui + Tailwind + TanStack Query + Recharts
- Auth: session-based, httpOnly cookie, argon2 password hash
- RBAC: roles = [owner, admin, member], server-enforced via middleware + row-level ownership checks
- Visual identity: Clean corporate archetype, DM Sans, 8px radius, comfortable density, accent-header-bar signature
- Threat model: tenant isolation is the critical boundary; highest-blast-radius op is cross-tenant `DELETE` in admin panel

## ADRs written
- 001-prisma-over-drizzle.md
- 002-session-cookie-not-jwt.md
- 003-audit-log-as-append-only-table.md

## Open questions blocking work
- [open, target: billing slice] Stripe vs. Lemon Squeezy. Blocks: billing schema and webhook endpoint cannot be written without the choice.

## Next slice
Billing. Needs: Stripe webhook endpoint, `subscription` + `invoice` schema, plan-change flow, dunning emails.

## Last session note
[2026-04-22] Finished orders audit log. Skipped analytics page for now (Tier 3 item). Hollow check clean. Ghost dep check clean.
```

**Rules:**
- STATE.md is the contract with the next session. If it is out of date, the next session will do the wrong thing.
- At every `/compact`, `/clear`, or context reset, update STATE.md first. Do not rely on the agent's memory.
- The `Active architectural decisions` block is the short version of the ADR corpus. Agents reading STATE.md on resume should not need to open every ADR to know the stack.
- Never delete STATE.md. If an entry is wrong, correct it in place with a dated note.

### Open-questions lifecycle

The `Open questions blocking work` block is the same graveyard risk as `.production-ready/deferred-cta.md`: an escape hatch with no exit. Apply the same discipline.

**Entry schema.** Every question must name:
- **Status:** one of `open` (awaiting answer), `answered` (with the answer recorded inline, then promoted to the architectural-decisions block or an ADR on the next update), `dropped` (one-line reason). Dropped entries stay in the file for audit history.
- **Target:** the named slice or tier boundary where the question must be answered.
- **Blocks:** what the question prevents. Specific, not vague. "Billing schema and webhook endpoint cannot be written without the choice" is specific. "We need to decide later" is not.

**Tier-boundary review.** At every tier boundary, walk the block entry by entry:
- Answered questions: promote the answer to the architectural-decisions block (if it shifts the stack or permission model) or to an ADR (if it made a non-obvious trade-off), then close the entry by marking `answered` with the resolution date.
- Open questions whose blocker is unchanged: append a check date. Questions stuck `open` across two tier boundaries are a signal the work needs to stall until the user decides, or the question should be `dropped` if the feature it blocks can be cut.
- Dropped questions: write a one-line reason. They stay in the file so future agents and humans see the decision history, not a mystery gap.

**Tier 4 closure gate.** Tier 4 (Hardened) cannot be declared complete while any question is `open`. Every entry must be `answered` or `dropped`. Shipping Hardened with open questions means shipping uncertainty.

**Drift signal.** More than 5 live `open` questions is a signal the slice scope is drifting. Either the scope needs to shrink, or the slice cannot start until the user answers the decisions gating it.

## Suite membership

production-ready is the building-tier core of the **ready-suite**, a composable set of skills covering the full arc from idea to launch. See `SUITE.md` at the repo root for the full map. The relevant siblings at a glance:

- **Planning tier:** `prd-ready` (what), `architecture-ready` (how), `roadmap-ready` (when), `stack-ready` (with what tools).
- **Building tier:** `production-ready` (this skill, the app), `repo-ready` (the repo scaffolding).
- **Shipping tier:** `deploy-ready` (ship it), `observe-ready` (keep it healthy), `launch-ready` (tell the world).

Skills are loosely coupled: each stands alone, each composes with the others via well-defined artifacts. No skill routes through another; the harness is the router. Install what you need.

## Consumes from upstream

When the agent starts, it checks for upstream artifacts and pre-fills the pre-flight from them rather than asking the user to repeat decisions already made. Absence is fine; the skill falls back to its own defaults. The specific reads:

| If present | production-ready reads it during | To pre-fill |
|---|---|---|
| `.prd-ready/PRD.md` | Step 1 (pre-flight) | Question 1 (who uses this, for what job), question 2 (domain entities), success criteria. |
| `.architecture-ready/ARCH.md` | Step 2 (architecture note) | System-level architecture decisions (monolith vs. services, sync vs. async, data-layer shape) adopted wholesale; local architecture note becomes a delta, not a redecision. |
| `.roadmap-ready/ROADMAP.md` | Step 1 and Step 5 (slice ordering) | Slice order aligned to milestone plan; CTAs whose chain falls outside the current milestone go directly to the deferred-cta.md list. |
| `.stack-ready/STACK.md` | Step 2 (architecture note) | Stack bullet is not re-decided; it quotes STACK.md. Pre-flight question 3 (what's the stack) already has the answer. |

If an upstream artifact *contradicts* what is in the existing code (Mode B/D), trust the code and note the drift. Upstream artifacts are historical records, not current-state overrides.

## Produces for downstream

production-ready emits the following artifacts for downstream skills to consume. Writing these is not optional for Tier 4; they are the contract with deploy-ready and observe-ready.

| Artifact | Path | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| **Session state** | `.production-ready/STATE.md` | `deploy-ready` reads the current tier, the stack, and the last known-green build to scope the first deployment pipeline. |
| **Decision records** | `.production-ready/adr/*.md` | `deploy-ready` reads ADRs that affect deploy (chosen DB, auth, session store). `observe-ready` reads ADRs that affect observability (audit log schema, event names, trace boundaries). |
| **Route map** | Extracted from the app at Step 2 | `observe-ready` reads to configure per-route tracing and alerting. |
| **Audit log schema** | From Tier 3 requirement #16 | `observe-ready` reads to wire audit events into log aggregation. |
| **Deferred-CTA list** | `.production-ready/deferred-cta.md` | `deploy-ready` blocks on this being closed (all entries `resolved` or `dropped`) before the first production deploy. No half-wired CTAs in production. |
| **Open-questions block** | Inside `STATE.md` | `deploy-ready` blocks on zero `open` questions before production deploy. |

If any downstream skill is not installed, production-ready still produces these artifacts. They cost nothing to emit and make the suite extensible: install `deploy-ready` later and it already has everything it needs.

## Handoff: repo hygiene is not this skill's job

If the work needs README, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING, CI pipelines, issue or PR templates, branch protection, dependency scanning, CODEOWNERS, or release automation, delegate to `repo-ready`. The two skills compose: production-ready owns the app wiring; repo-ready owns the repo scaffolding. Do not duplicate either.

**If your harness exposes a skill-invocation tool** (e.g., Claude Code's Skill tool), invoke `repo-ready` directly when the handoff trigger fires. **Otherwise**, surface the handoff to the user: "This step needs `repo-ready`. Install it or handle the repo hygiene layer separately." Do not attempt to generate CI, LICENSE, or release automation inline from this skill.

## Keep going until it's actually done

The main pages existing is roughly 40% of the work. The remaining 60% is empty states, error states, validation, permissions on every mutation, the audit log, the settings page, the profile page, the logout flow, the responsive breakpoints, the keyboard tab order, the loading skeletons, the success toasts, the cache invalidation, the seed data, and the verification pass. Budget for all of it.

A "done" dashboard is one a real person can hand to a colleague without a list of caveats. When in doubt, open the dashboard and try to do the user's actual job with it. The first thing you can't do is the next thing to build.
